# JS Speech Recognition

## Description

This exercise uses the *SpeechRecognition* global variable of the browser in order to detect what the user is saying, while rendering the result in the DOM.

Some actions are also executed when detecting certain words such as 'Open Google', 'Cat' or 'Dog', just a few examples of the infinite uses we could achieve. 

## Javascript Used

* SpeechRecognition()
* querySelector()
* advanced DOM
* Array.from()
* map()
* join()
* includes()
* toLowerCase()
* event listeners related to SpeechRecognition (result, end)
* browser-sync in order to create a server and access to the browser's microphone
